ZenPlayer-for-iOS
=================

ZenPlayer is originally designed by [simurai](http://lab.simurai.com/zen-player/) with CSS3 and JavaScript.
This version of ZenPlayer is wrote with objective-c using ARC(Auto Reference Counting) for my application called [walknote](http://pkpk.info/app/walknote/).
Its graphics are redrew bigger size, so it's suitable on retina display.
It would be helpful for everyone who wants to implement cool design button with animation like ZenPlayer.
